    Maybe one time, maybe two<br>
    </p><p>
    Something happens in the morning<br>

    I can't find a good word for ya<br>
    Does it come as a surprise?<br>
    </p><p>
    I don't think we'd rhyme<br>
    I will wear you down in time<br>
    I will hurt you, I'll desert you<br>
    I am Jackie down the line<br>
    </p><p>
    Said did Sally 'bout a future<br>
    Before you bored of her as well<br>
    If all you want is entertainment<br>
    If you can't have it you make hell<br>
    </p><p>
    Don't make no odds for you<br>
    To be told, yeah<br>

    So come on down to Sally's boneyard<br>
    See her spirit in decline<br>
    See the handsome mourners crying<br>
    They hawked a beating heart for a sturdy spine, yeah<br>
    </p><p>
    What good is happiness to me<br>
    If I've to wield it carefully?<br>
    For care I'll always come up short<br>
    It's only right<br>

    I am Jackie down the line<br>
